Default base address seems to be 0x30 - 0x37

FD1771 A0, A1 connected to S-100 A0, A1 (buffered)

E1 status register                 to internal bidirectional bus, inverting
D1 from S-100 data out             to internal bidirectional bus, inverting
C1 from internal bidirectional bus to S-100 data in bus, inverting
B1 ??? to S-100 data in bus, noninverting, might be switch register related?

Status register at 0x34, 0x35:
	Bit 0	Drive Select bit 0 (binary)
	Bit 1	Drive Select bit 1 (binary)
	Bit 2
	Bit 3
	Bit 4	Disk Initialization Status (1 = ON)
	Bit 5	*READY flip-flop
	Bit 6	FDC INTRQ
	Bit 7	FDC DRQ

NOTE: Bit 4, Disk Initialization, is irrelevant if SW1, position 8 is open (disk init
hard disabled)

FD1771 at 0x30 - 0x33

G1 pin 5 = *BINARY_DS1
G1 pin 6 = BINARY_DS1
H1 pin 8 = BINARY_DS0
H1 pin 9 = *BINARY_DS0

Control register at 0x35
	Bit 0	Drive select bit 0 (binary)
	Bit 1	Drive select bit 1 (binary)
	Bit 2
	Bit 3
	Bit 4	Disk Initialization control (1 = ON)
	Bit 5	Ready arm

NOTE: Bit 4, Disk Initialization, is ignored if SW1, position 8 is open (disk init hard
disabled)

TO SELECT A DRIVE:

Write a byte to the control register at 0x35, bit 5 must always be high, two low bits
select the drive:
	0x20	Invalid
	0x21	*DS1 active
	0x22	*DS2 active
	0x23	*DS3 active

SWITCH SW1:

	Pos 1
	Pos 2
	Pos 3
	Pos 4
	Pos 5
	Pos 6
	Pos 7
	Pos 8	OPEN for disk init disable, CLOSED for disk init by CONTROL_BIT4

Head Load output is used to enable the motors on Shugart interface.
